# Weather-Forecasting-Temperatures-in-Oklahoma
This project focuses on forecasting average temperatures in Oklahoma using historical weather data from 2013 to 2023 collected via Mesonet weather stations. Developed entirely in R, the project applies various time series modeling techniques including ARIMA, ETS, linear regression, random forest, and neural networks (NNETAR) to analyze seasonal patterns and predict future temperatures. After evaluating model performance using RMSE, the fine-tuned NNETAR model achieved the highest accuracy (RMSE â‰ˆ 0.98) and was used to forecast temperatures over a 3-year period for five key regions in Oklahoma. The analysis revealed strong correlations between temperature and dew point and offers valuable insights for sectors such as agriculture, transportation, and emergency planning.
